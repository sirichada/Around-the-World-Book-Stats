        <p>This first visualization is an area and bar chart that represents the number of books published over time in the world. The data is a 1024-record copy from book_works_goodreads.json, and the numerical data from the "original_publication_year" was used. Try hovering over the datapoints (circle) in each year to find out exactly how many books were published in that year.</p>

        <p>Explore what genres the world is reading through this World Cloud from a copy of 1033-record copy of books_genre_goodreads.json, or the top typically placed bookshelves that these books are a part of. The larger the genre text is, the more people are reading it. Refresh for a new Word Cloud!</p>

    <h2>Where are the books coming from?</h2>
    <p> From a sample of 1026 records in books_goodreads.json, here are what languages the books were originally published as. Like the first chart, you can hover over each country to find out exactly how many books were published in that language.</p>
