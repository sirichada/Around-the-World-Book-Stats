# What Is the World Reading? - Around the World Book Stats
### about this visualization
My design started with a question, What are people reading? I wanted to understand not only what people are reading, but also what was popular and most commonly read. To represent this, I proposed three additional questions: how many books has the world been reading, what kind of books is the world reading, and where are the books coming from? 
<br /> 
<br />
And so, I created What Is the World Reading?, a data visualization representation of the questionsâ€™ answers based on the data from Goodreads as collected by the University of California San Diego. The audience for this visualization would be the general public as I tried to make the website accessible by using simple data representations with minimal clutter to lessen confusion.
